# Angular Workflow - A Node-Based Workflow Editor

**Angular Workflow** is an open-source library that offers functionality similar to the popular **React Flow** library, built specifically for Angular applications. It provides a powerful and flexible node-based diagram editor where users can drag and drop nodes, connect them with curved lines, and create complex workflows visually.

## Key Features

- **Node-based Interaction**: Users can select nodes from a list and drag them into a playground area to build workflows intuitively.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Seamlessly drag nodes onto the canvas to arrange and organize the workflow.
- **Curved Connections**: Connect nodes using smooth, curved lines to clearly define the flow of data or logic.
- **Directed Arrows**: Each connection line features arrows to represent the direction of the workflow.
- **Customizable Nodes**: Easily modify node properties to suit different applications.
- **Fully Interactive**: Nodes and connections can be rearranged, allowing real-time updates to your workflow structure.
- **Angular-friendly**: Designed for seamless integration into Angular projects, making it easy to implement workflows in any Angular application.

## Usage

This project works similarly to **[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/examples)**, but for Angular-based environments. The nodes and edges can be customized to fit any use case, from business process modeling to data flow diagrams.
